remgdb: debugging user-level MINIX processes with gdb
Robert Zulawnik, January 2002  

This package contains a conversion utility for translating
MINIX ACK and a.out files into UNIX a.out format, so that
they can be used as a source of debug information for gdb.
It also contains gdbserver adapted for MINIX - it is a piece
of code that allows for remote hookup of gdb. The debug 
session requires 2 systems with serial ports connected via
a null modem cable. One of them hosts gdb itself (i.e. runs
an OS capable of hosting gdb), while the other one is a
MINIX box running processes that can be debugged at source
level. Detailed descriptions are provided in the README file.

Note added by asw 10 Feb 2002: the tar file has been repackaged. 
Place the tar file in /usr/local/src and execute the command:

compress -d < remgdb.tar.Z | tar xvfp -

This will create /usr/local/src/remgdb and unpack the archive 
into the new directory. Consult the README file for instructions.
